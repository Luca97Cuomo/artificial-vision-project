# Age estimation framework

This framework allows you to build, train and test your net. You just need to modify a default configuration file.
This framework is not intended for production-grade use. It was created in order to speed up different experiments combining architectures and various parameters.

## Installation

### Colab
It is strongly recommended to clone this repository on Google Colab instead cloning it on your personal machine.
This is because on Colab you don't have to install any dependencies and you won't have problem with CUDA libraries.

All you need to do is choose tensorflow version.

```python 
%tensorflow_version 1 # 1 or 2

import tensorflow
print(tensorflow.__version__)
```

#### Tensorflow 1
If you want to use tensorflow 1 the only dependency to install is `keras-vggface`:

```shell script
pip install git+https://github.com/rcmalli/keras-vggface.git
```

### Personal computer

Clone this repository on your machine and execute:

```shell script
# TF 1
pip install git+https://github.com/rcmalli/keras-vggface.git
pip install -r requirements_tf1.txt

# TF 2
pip install -r requirements_tf2.txt
```
#### CUDA and cuDNN dependencies

Tested CUDA and cuDNN versions that works well with the framework:

```
- CUDA Toolkit: 10.1 (TF2)
- CUDA Toolkit: 10.0 (TF1)
- cuDNN: 7.6.5
```

## Usage

### Prepare the dataset

### Build your model

If you want to build your own model you need to write a json configuration file and pass it to the build model script.
You can see a template of the build configuration file:

```json
{
    "model_name": "name for you model",
    "input_shape": "input shape of your net, you can pass a json list like this [224, 224, 3]",
    "output_type": "choose one in ['regression', 'rvc', 'random_bins_classification']",
    "verbose": "true or false",

    "build": {
      "build_model_dir": "folder path where you want to save your model",
      "build_learning_rate": "learning rate of your model, it must be a number",

      "dense_layer_structure_name": "choose one in ['standard_dense_layer_structure', 'vgg16_dense_layer_structure']",

      "backend": {
        "name": "choose one in ['vgg16', 'resnet50', 'senet50'] if you're using TF1, choose one in ['vgg19'] if you're using TF2",
        "unlock_layers": "this is the number of layers (from the end of the net) you want to unlock for training, choose one in ['none', 'all', 1, 2, ..]"
      }
    }
}
```

For `"standard_dense_layer_structure"` we refer to:

```python

def standard_dense_layer_structure(backbone):
    global_pool = GlobalAveragePooling2D()
    x = global_pool(backbone)

    x = Dense(4096, activation='relu', kernel_initializer='he_normal')(x)
    x = Dense(2048, activation='relu', kernel_initializer='he_normal')(x)
    x = Dense(1024, activation='relu', kernel_initializer='he_normal')(x)

    return x

```

After created the configuration file just run the following script to build your model:

```shell script

python3 build_model.py -c "build_configuration_path"

```

The build model script will generate a metadata file, in your model output dir, useful for the training procedure. It will be something like this:

```json
{
  "monitored_quantity": "val_mae",
  "normalization_function_name": "vgg16_normalization",
  "predict_function_name": "rvc_predict_function",
  "input_shape": [
    224,
    224,
    3
  ],
  "output_type": "rvc"
}
```

### Train your net

To train your net you need to write a json configuration file and pass it to the train model script.
You can see a template of the train configuration file:

```json

{
    "model_path": "path of the model, it is a directory if you're using TF2, it is a file if you're using TF1",
    "csv_path": "path of the labels saved in csv file",
    "metadata_path": "path of the metadata file generated by the build script",
    "model_name": "name of your model",
    "tf_version": "the version of tensorflow you're using now that must be equal to the version you used to build the model, choose one in [1, 2]",

    "verbose": "true or false",

    "preprocessing": {
        "enabled": "true or false, if true the training data will be preprocessed",
        "preprocessing_function_name": "choose on in ['standard_preprocessing_function']"
    },

    "train": {
        "training_set_path": "path of the training set",
        "validation_set_path": "path of the validation set",
        "checkpoint_path": "if you want to train with tf 1, the checkpoint must be specified in model_path, this is useful only for models built with TF2.",
        "num_training_samples": "the number of training samples, it must be an integer",
        "num_validation_samples": "the number of validation samples, it must be an integer",
        "augmentations": "true or false, if true data will be randomly augmented with different corruptions during the training",
        "epochs": "number of epochs, it must be an integer",
        "batch_size": "the batch size you want to use, it must be an integer",
        "initial_epoch": "0 if you want to start from the first epoch",
        "train_learning_rate": "if not null, the learning rate of the model, chosen during the build, will be changed",
        "output_training_dir": "directory path where checkpoints and model outputs will be stored",
        "save_best_only": "true or false, if false all the checkpoints are going to be saved, otherwise only the best checkpoints"
    }
}

```

For `"standard_preprocessing_function"` we refer to the following preprocessing:

- Detect the most relevant face into the image with opencv face detector.
- Crop the face into a square.
- Resize the cropped image with the input shape given into the metadata file. 


After created the configuration file just run the following script to train your model:
```shell script

python3 train.py -c "train_configuration_path"

```

### Test your net

To test your net you need to write a json configuration file and pass it to the evaluate model script.
You can see a template of the evaluate configuration file:

```json

{
    "model_path": "path of the model, it is a directory if you're using TF2, it is a file if you're using TF1",
    "csv_path": "path of the labels saved in csv file, null if you have to test your net on images without labels",
    "metadata_path": "path of the metadata file generated by the build script",
    "tf_version": "the tensorflow version that you're using now, choose one in [1, 2]",

    "verbose": "true or false",

    "preprocessing": {
        "enabled": "true or false, if true the test data will be preprocessed",
        "preprocessing_function_name": "choose on in ['standard_preprocessing_function']"
    },

    "evaluate": {
        "test_set_path": "path of the test set",
        "num_test_samples": "number of test set samples you want to use, ignored if csv_path is null",

        "save_predictions": {
            "enabled": "true or false",
            "save_predictions_path": "path where to save predictions"
        },

        "age_intervals_evaluation": {
            "enabled": "true or false, if true the mae will be evaluated on different age intervals. Ignored if csv_path is null.",
            "age_interval_width": "number of age intervals to consider during age intervals evaluation, it must be a number. Ignored if csv_path is null."
        }
    }
}

```
